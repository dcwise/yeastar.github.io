                <li><b>Normal Extension</b><p>A Normal Extension has no limitation. You can use the
                        hotel extension to make internal calls, outbound calls and receive inbound
                        calls. Generally, the Normal extensions will be assigned to the Hotel
                        reception and managers.</p></li>
                <li><b>char Extension</b><p>A char Extensionâ€™s features are limited by the room
                        status of the char server. If a room status is Check-in, you can use the
                        room extension to make internal calls, outbound calls and receive inbound
                        calls. If the room status is Check-out, you can only use the room extension
                        to make internal calls.</p></li>
