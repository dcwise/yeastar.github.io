      <p><image href="../Images/horizon.png" id="image_syz_21w_pdb"/></p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_pd2_5vk_jdb">
          <li>Fixed event center issue: when the PBX used Dual network mode, if you disconnected
            network cables for both LAN and WAN port, the system would not send notification.</li>
          <li>Fixed CDR issue: if you change the E1 trunk name, the CDR would display an incorrect
            E1 trunk name.</li>
          <li>Fixed the issue that if an extension user download call logs from web, he would
            download all the call logs on the system even he didn’t have the privilege.</li>
          <li>Fixed the SD card issue: the system would always warn you that the SD card format was
            wrong.</li>
          <li>Fixed event center issue: if you use GSM/3G trunk to call out and the called party
            declined, the system would treat this call as a failed call and send you a
            notification.</li>
          <li>Fixed VoIP trunk issue: if you enable proxy server, and disable it again, then save
            the changes, the VoIP trunk would not work properly. </li>
          <li>Fixed conference issue: if a conference moderator extension is in an extension group,
            the moderator would be required to enter a password to enter the conference.</li>
          <li>Fixed custom prompt issue: two prompt files would be created if you made a custom
            prompt using an extension.</li>
          <li>Fixed conference issue: if you invited users to one conference, the system concurrent
            calls would be twice of the invited users. </li>
          <li>Fixed SMS to Email issue: emails received in Foxmail would display incorrect received
            time.</li>
          <li>Fixed one touch recording issue: if you changed extension A’s default Caller ID, and
            use extension A call to extension B, press *1 to make one touch record; this call would
            not be recorded in CDR. </li>
          <li>Fixed one touch recording issue: in an internal call, if the two extension users both
            press *1 to make one touch record; this call would not be recorded in CDR.</li>
          <li>Fixed network drive issue: if the shared folder name is a Chinese name, the network
            drive could not be mounted to PBX.</li>
          <li>Fixed Email to SMS issue: received contents in your mobile phone might be incomplete
            if you write too many contents in the email. </li>
          <li>Fixed the temporary voicemail message issue.</li>
          <li>Fixed holiday time condition issue: the system computed holiday time incorrectly.</li>
          <li>Fixed LDAP phonebook issue: edit the default LDAP phonebook, set the settings as one
            new created phonebook settings, then all the phonebooks would be changed to the same
            phonebook automatically.</li>
          <li>Fixed compatibility issue with IE11 browser: users could not listen and download
            recordings on IE11.</li>
          <li>Fixed queue issue: when you called in a queue, if you pressed any key on your phone
            when you were waiting for answer, the call would be disconnected automatically.</li>
          <li>Fixed SIP trunk issue: for a registered and active SIP trunk, if the SIP provider
            always requires an Expires field in REGISTER packets, the SIP trunk would turn into an
            unavailable trunk.</li>
          <li>Fixed queue issue: if the ring strategy was set to “Ring All”, some queue members
            might not ring at the same time.</li>
          <li>Fixed PPPoE issue: if you set store system logs to one network drive, and changed
            network mode to PPPoE, the system could not obtain network.</li>
          <li>Fixed VLAN issue: if network mode was DHCP, VLAN could not work.</li>

            automatically delete digit 0. </li>

            cause the page no response.</li>

            reach 100%.</li>
          <li>Fixed the issue that feature code *8 was not available.</li>

            could not work properly.</li>
          <li>Fixed PBX center app issue: updating PBX center would cause all the extension being
            unavailable.</li>
          <li>Fixed user permission issue: if you set the privilege as “Custom”, and granted “voice
            prompts” privilege for the user, the privilege would be invalid for the user. </li>
          <li>Fixed recording prompt issue: if you set inbound route to one callback destination,
            the system did not play the recording prompt for the incoming calls.</li>
          <li>Fixed connection issue between two S-Series PBXs: PBX1 set NAT mode to STUN, PBX2 set
            NAT mode to external IP address, internal calls between the two PBXs could not work
            properly. </li>
          <li>Fixed the CDR issue: if an extension user pressed *1 to make one touch recording, he
            could not check the call log on web.</li>
          <li>Fixed the issue that SIP Registration/Subscription settings could not take effect. </li>

            properly. </li>
          <li>Fixed the issue that if an incoming call is forwarded to an external number, this call
            would not be recorded.</li>
          <li>Fixed VoIP trunk issue: if “Hostname/IP” and “Domain” were set differently, the trunk
            could not work properly. </li>
          <li>Fixed the issue that adding user permission would fail if there were 300 extension
            users on the PBX.</li>
          <li>Fixed G729/G723/iLBC codec issue: multiple concurrent calls with the codecs would
            cause the system freezing up.</li>
