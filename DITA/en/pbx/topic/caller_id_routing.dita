        <p>If a call comes in from [<i>Given Number</i>] then send the call to [<i>Given
                Destination</i>]‚Äù which will in effect, send all calls that follow the rule to the
            right department, individual, queue or voicemail and enable you to utilise your staff
            more effectively.</p>
        <p>This is a beneficial feature for companies whose sales/service teams cover specified
            regions. Calls are routed by the originating area code to a specific person or office
            location. Numbers that fall outside the standard area codes (such as 800 numbers or
            blocked numbers) could be sent directly to a designated account manager.</p>
